        <p>The Taj Mahal was commissioned by Shah Jahan in 1631, to be built in the memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal,
             who died on 17 June that year, while giving birth to their 14th child, Gauhara Begum.Construction 
             started in 1632, and the mausoleum was completed in 1648, while the surrounding buildings and garden were 
            finished five years later. The imperial court documenting Shah Jahan's grief after the death of Mumtaz
             Mahal illustrates the love story held as the inspiration for the Taj Mahal.</p>

            <p>The Red Fort or Lal Qila (Hindustani: [laːlqiːlaː]) is a historic fort in Old Delhi, Delhi in India that 
                served as the main residence of the Mughal Emperors. Emperor Shah Jahan commissioned construction of the 
                Red Fort on 12 May 1638, when he decided to shift his capital from Agra to Delhi. Originally red and white,
                its design is credited to architect Ustad Ahmad Lahori, who also constructed the Taj Mahal. The fort 
                represents the peak in Mughal architecture under Shah Jahan.</p>

            <p>The Qutub Minar, also spelled as Qutb Minar and Qutab Minar, is a minaret and "victory tower" that forms 
                part of the Qutb complex. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site in the Mehrauli area of New Delhi, India. It 
                is one of most visited tourist spots in the city due to it being one of the earliest that survives in the 
                Indian subcontinent. It can be compared to the 62-metre all-brick Minaret of Jam in Afghanistan, of c. 1190,
                which was constructed a decade or so before the probable start of the Delhi tower.</p>
